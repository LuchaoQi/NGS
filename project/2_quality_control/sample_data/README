This directory contains several read sets that are the starting point for the
challenge.  The reads were generated by taking a portion of an organism's
reference sequence and inserting a secret message into the genome.
Your challenge is to identify the inserted sequence and decode the message.

You can use the included dna-encode.pl script to decode the message.  It uses
the algorithm defined in George M. Church, Yuan Gao, and Sriram Kosuri.

(https://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/08/15/science.1226355.full).  If
you have Perl installed on your computer, you can get the documentation for the
dna-encode.pl script with the following command:

  $ perldoc dna-encode.pl

You can get a brief synopsis of the command with this command:

  $ perl dna-encode.pl --help

The types of reads in each FASTQ (.fq) file are described in detail below.

frag180.1.fq   Read 1 of Illumina 2x100 reads from 180 +/- 20 bp fragments
frag180.2.fq   Read 2 of Illumina 2x100 reads from 180 +/- 20 bp fragments
jump2k.1.fq    Read 1 of Illumina 2x50  reads from 2000 +/- 200 bp fragments
jump2k.2.fq    Read 2 of Illumina 2x50  reads from 2000 +/- 200 bp fragments
